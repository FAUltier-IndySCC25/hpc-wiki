# HPC-Wiki

Wiki for HPC stuff, designed for being used in student cluster competitions (like at [SC](https://supercomputing.org/), [ISC](https://isc-hpc.com/) and [ASC](http://asc-events.org/)).
Based on [Vitepress](https://vitepress.dev/).

The goal is to accumulate information and make it easily accessible for later generations of SCC students.

## Development

First, install all necessary npm packages:

```
npm install
```

To run the site locally for testing:

```
npm run docs:dev
```

## Deployment

(still getting sorted out)
